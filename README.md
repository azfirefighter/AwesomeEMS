# Awesome EMS
A collection of open source resources around the internet related to Emergency Medical Services. This is mostly about software, hardware or protocols, but there are some educational resources as well.

## Dispatch

* A ruby-based dispatch system called [skycad](https://github.com/shakycode/skycad).
* [TicketsCAD](http://www.ticketscad.org/) appears to be under active development.
* A really old (2009) web-based dispatch system called [WebEMS](http://webems.sourceforge.net/). 
* [OpenISES](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openises/?source=navbar), another old project. The website claims there is an attempt to revive it, and the latest tarball is dated August, 2016. 
* The [Medic Mobile](https://github.com/medic) project is meant to help coordinate activities in areas where there is only SMS available.

## Dynamic Deployment

* A [research project](https://github.com/4rdhendu/Ambulance-multi-agent-planning) about optimizing ambulance assignment. The paper and code are available.
* A [simple system](https://github.com/ViditIsOnline/SLOR_Back) for visualizing placement of ambulances.
* [traccar](https://www.traccar.org/) has open source apps for android and iOS. It could be used to track ambulance personnel.

## Study and Education

* A [simple system](https://github.com/ViditIsOnline/SLOR_Back) for visualizing placement of ambulances.
* The [Free Open Access to Medical EDucation](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/collections/) project brings together medical educational information. There is also a [Search Engine](http://googlefoam.com) and a [twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/foamed), and [several](https://twitter.com/hashtag/foampara) [other](https://twitter.com/hashtag/foamcc) [EMS-oriented](https://twitter.com/hashtag/foamems) versions of the hashtag as well.
* Every Paramedic has likely already found [ecgpedia](http://en.ecgpedia.org), but here it is anyway.
* [EMD Cards](http://www.tablonenblanco.com/Ticket/emd_cards/EMD_Card_Version_0.26.2.pdf) is a freely available emergency medical dispatch guidebook. Obviously you're gonna want to run that one by medical control first.
* [emsprotocols.org](http://www.emsprotocols.org/) is a website that attempts to keep up with the latest and greatest protocols that are available online.
* [Vital Sign Simulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vitalsignsim/) can be used to "fake" a lifepack for simulations with a dummy.

## Data

* This isn't really open source, but it's the future of EMS data - [NEMSIS](http://www.nemsis.org/index.html).
* [PhysioNet](http://www.physionet.org/) has recorded physiological data for that deep learning ECG simulator you always wanted to write. PhysioNet also has a list of software you can use for various kinds of data. If you need a program to detect apnea waveforms or QRS waves, you might just find it here.

There are a *lot* of EHR/EMR systems out there. I'm not going to list them, but [here](http://www.ourmed.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_healthcare_software) is a really large list.

## Apps

* [epmobile](https://github.com/mannd/epmobile) is an open source app aimed at electrophysiology.

## Devices

* [Zephyr Open](https://code.google.com/archive/p/zephyropen/) is a Java library for communicating with "BlueTooth Physiological Sensors".
* The Linux Anasthesia Modular Devices Interface ([lamdi](gasnet.med.yale.edu/lamdi/)) sounds interesting, but the site seems to be down.

## GIS

* [Quantum GIS](qgis.org) is a very useful tool for all sorts of geospatial work.
* [PostGIS](postgis.net) is an add-on module for the most excellent [PostgreSQL](postgresql.org) database server that provides geospatial capabilities for PostgreSQL.
* [pgRouting](pgrouting.org) is another PostgreSQL add-on that enables all sorts of routing features. Works with [Open Street Maps](openstreetmap.org) data and has some extremely useful features for EMS planning.


## Other

* [OpenMedSpel](https://www.openhub.net/p/openmedspel) is a medical spelling checker. There is a firefox addon, but this open source project appears to be a server of some kind.
