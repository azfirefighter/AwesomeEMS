* A ruby-based dispatch system called [skycad](https://github.com/shakycode/skycad).
* A really old (2009) web-based dispatch system called [WebEMS](http://webems.sourceforge.net/). 
* [OpenISES](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openises/?source=navbar), another old project. The website claims there is an attempt to revive it, and the latest tarball is dated August, 2016. 

## Dynamic Deployment

* A [research project](https://github.com/4rdhendu/Ambulance-multi-agent-planning) about optimizing ambulance assignment. The paper and code are available.
* A [simple system](https://github.com/ViditIsOnline/SLOR_Back) for visualizing placement of ambulances.

## Study and Education

* A [simple system](https://github.com/ViditIsOnline/SLOR_Back) for visualizing placement of ambulances.
* The [Free Open Access to Medical EDucation](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/collections/) project brings together medical educational information. There is also a [Search Engine](http://googlefoam.com) and a [twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/foamed), and [several](https://twitter.com/hashtag/foampara) [other](https://twitter.com/hashtag/foamcc) [EMS-oriented](https://twitter.com/hashtag/foamems) versions of the hashtag as well.
* Every Paramedic has likely already found [ecgpedia](http://en.ecgpedia.org), but here it is anyway.

## Data

* This isn't really open source, but it's the future of EMS data - [NEMSIS](http://www.openhealthnews.com/content/national-ems-information-system-nemsis).
